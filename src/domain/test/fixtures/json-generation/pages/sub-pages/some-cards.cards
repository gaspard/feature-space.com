Find the limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x.

<details>

<summary>Solution</summary>

Using L'Hôpital's rule: lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = lim(x→0) cos(x)/1 = cos(0) = 1

What is the chain rule?

<details>

<summary>Solution</summary>

If h(x) = f(g(x)), then h'(x) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x). The derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function.
