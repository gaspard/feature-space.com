# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds mathematical equation rendering capabilities using KaTeX and implements a two-level file-based navigation system for the Astro website. The system will automatically generate navigation from the file structure and provide seamless math rendering for educational or technical content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write mathematical equations in markdown using LaTeX syntax, so that I can create technical documentation with properly formatted mathematical expressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes LaTeX math syntax in markdown THEN the system SHALL render it as formatted mathematical equations using KaTeX
2. WHEN a user uses inline math with `$...$` syntax THEN the system SHALL render it inline with the text
3. WHEN a user uses display math with `$$...$$` syntax THEN the system SHALL render it as a centered block equation
4. WHEN KaTeX encounters invalid LaTeX syntax THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without breaking the page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to navigate through content using an organized menu structure, so that I can easily find and access different sections of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL automatically generate navigation from the file structure in the pages directory
2. WHEN there are nested directories THEN the system SHALL create a two-level navigation hierarchy
3. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding page
4. WHEN viewing a page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current page in the navigation menu

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation system to be file-based, so that adding new pages automatically updates the navigation without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new markdown or Astro file is added to the pages directory THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the navigation
2. WHEN a file is organized in a subdirectory THEN the system SHALL group it under the appropriate navigation section
3. WHEN a file has frontmatter with a title THEN the system SHALL use that title in the navigation
4. IF a file doesn't have a title THEN the system SHALL generate a readable title from the filename

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to test the KaTeX functionality with sample mathematical content, so that I can verify the system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN there SHALL be sample pages with various mathematical expressions
2. WHEN viewing the sample content THEN it SHALL demonstrate both inline and display math rendering
3. WHEN the sample content loads THEN all mathematical expressions SHALL render correctly without errors
4. WHEN testing different types of math notation THEN the system SHALL support common LaTeX mathematical symbols and structures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm as the package manager for all development phases, so that I can maintain consistency with the existing project setup and ensure reliable dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing new dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm commands for package installation
2. WHEN running development scripts THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for script execution
3. WHEN testing the implementation THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for running tests and development servers
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL use pnpm for the build process
